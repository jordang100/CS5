In some cases, models can greatly benefit people. As illustrated in Kang Lee’s TED Talk “Can you really tell if a kid is lying?”, he was able to determine whether a person was lying by using a process called transdermal optical imaging. Using the same method, he could determine someone’s heart rate, mood, etc… Hence, I partially agree with Chris Anderson. Sometimes models are wrong, but they can also be useful.
