Artificial intelligence is all around us. It was compelling to learn that Watson was able to construct complex yet grammatically correct sentences. Chatbots such as the Mistuku Chatbot can attribute their inspiration to Watson as it was a major breakthrough in the world of AI. Additionally, AI is further being used via telephones. Recently when I called Apple, they had an intelligent virtual assistant that could interpret what I said and would act accordingly. However, Watson-style thinking lasts some humanistic traits. For example with the U.S. cities with the WWII memorial, it sought through hundreds of cities to scour for evidence. In contrast, humans would instinctively think of major cities such as Chicago.
