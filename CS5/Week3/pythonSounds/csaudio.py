# Notes for when this program breaks:
#  - This program is first called by the hw3pr1 file to run play(filename). 
#  - The next call is to read_wav(filename), which in turn calls:
#     - get_data(filename), which pulls out the parameters and raw frames 
#        of the sound file
#     - These then get passed to tr(params,rf), which gets the list of floats 
#        (sound_data) that hw3pr1.py runs all the list comprehensions on
#  - Next call is to write_wav(sound_data, desired filename), which in turn calls: 
#     - tri(params, data), which converts the float list into a bunch of bytes
#     - write_wav(params, rawframesstring, filename) which takes in all the bytes
#        and converts it to a sound file
