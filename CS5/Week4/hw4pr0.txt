Sometimes, the unexpected occurs. When Gangnam Style reached YouTube’s view limit, the view count became negative. Likewise, “when the guidance system’s own computer tried to convert [sideways velocity] from a  64-bit format to a 16-bit format. The number was too big, and an overflow error resulted.” Hence, it is important to expected the unexpected and to never take risks (especially when dealing with $7 billion). They could have just stuck with the safe 64-bit format. Additionally, the statement that software “does not fail in the same sense as a mechanical system” is true. When you drop an iPhone, the screen breaks and the phone may become broken. It is the result of the user’s error and not because of the code. When there is a bug in a code, it is much more lenient to fix (AKA debugging) unlike having to replace a part on an iPhone ($$$).
