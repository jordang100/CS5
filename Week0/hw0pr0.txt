Like the example of the boy having a hard time learning to dance in a different environment, I feel the same way when transitioning between the Chinese and English language. In Chinese, when someone asks you if you don’t like something, you say “yes” whereas in English, you say “no, I don’t like that.” Hence why sometimes when I’m speaking in English, I sometimes mix up the response. A few days ago, I asked “Do you mind if I take this chair?”, and the person replied “yes” when he meant, “no, I don’t mind.” In conclusion, different languages have their specifications such as with English and Guugu Yimithirr.
