On the Human or Machine quiz, I scored four out of six. I was able to distinguish some machine written sonnets because they didn’t flow logically. For example, in sonnet #5, the machine transitions too often, jumping from describing a “sweet sing” to a “world of gain.” However, the majority of the machine written poems still sounded very human-like. If machines can perfect the human language, I fear that they may inherit their programmer’s bias. On the contrary, having machines generate text will instigate a new wave of informational transmission, permitting us to learn much more about the world.
