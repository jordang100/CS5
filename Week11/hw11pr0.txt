As the passage stated, “Humans - at least the best ones - are getting better at playing chess.” However, the benefits of computers are not limited to AI. In numerous studies such as one performed by Rochester.edu, it showed that video games “[improve] a wide variety of general skills that can help with everyday activities like multitasking, driving, reading small print, keeping track of friends in a crowd, and navigating around town.” Additionally, computers can also advance humanity's scientific pursuits. One example of such is NEBCutter (http://nc2.neb.com/NEBcutter2/), an online tool that helps you determine DNA bands. By not having to determine DNA bands, this eliminates tedious lab procedural work and allows scientists to delve into the “why certain bands come out as such?” rather than “what do the bands look like?”
