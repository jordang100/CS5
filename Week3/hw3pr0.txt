As stated in “Is the Universe a Simulation”, there is a likely probability that we are in a simulation. I found it very compelling to learn that perhaps our understandings of mathematics may just be code from a computer programmer who created our universe. This is reasonable as artificial intelligence is a growing field and simulations are able to learn to think and solve problems on their own as illustrated in “MarIO - Machine Learning for Video Games.” Hence it is possible that we are in a simulation. Even if that is true, life is still life. It doesn’t matter whether or not we are living in a simulation; it’s best to just live our lives as we have always lived them.
