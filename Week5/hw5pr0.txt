To prove that the water-droplet computer has a “universal nature,” the researchers can have the water droplets perform arithmetic, i.e., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. This arithmetic makes up any computer computation and can be manipulated to perform many functions. Additionally, DNA and RNA can be the raw material that biological computers are manipulating. As explored in https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bringing-dna-computers-to-life-2007-09/, DNA and RNA, like Turning’s machine, “process information stored in a string of symbols taken from a fixed alphabet, and operate by moving step by step along those strings, modifying or adding symbols according to a given set of rules.”
