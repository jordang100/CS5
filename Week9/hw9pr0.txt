I’m completely on board with what the “If Autonomous Vehicles Rule the World” advocates. There is no obvious downside to having autonomous vehicles aside from losing the “icons of personal freedom.” Having autonomous cars will greatly decrease traffic and car accidents and will limit the number of cars by “almost 90%”, hence aiding in decreasing air pollution. However, by computerizing cars, hackers will be able to remotely control a vehicle as shown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK0SrxBC1xs, putting a person’s life at risk. Even so, I see an extremely bright future ahead for the autonomous industry as its benefits massively outweigh its downsides.
